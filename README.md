# ML_marathon_financial-institution.
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a financial institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. You will have to analyze the dataset in order to find ways to look for future strategies in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank.
